# Verilog_Chipspirit_2023

These are some of the works I created (individually) while interning at Chipspirit Technologies Pvt. Ltd. and during my quest to learn and understand Verilog.
Please remember that while creating these projects, I had no training in Verilog, and I often fell into the habit of 'programming' it instead of designing using Verilog, and I was working on these almost independently (with some limited help from experts in the company). Following this summer internship, I was motivated to complete a course at my university (University of Southern California) about HDL and how to use it effectively, following which I have improved tremendously.
